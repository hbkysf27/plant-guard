# Plant Guard

Plant Guard is an AI-powered web application that helps users identify plants effortlessly. Simply upload an image of a plant, and the app provides its name, scientific details, and care instructions.

## Features

- Upload or capture an image to identify plants.
- AI-powered plant identification.
- Detailed scientific names and plant family insights.
- Care instructions tailored for each plant.
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile.

## Project Structure

The project consists of:

- **Frontend**: Built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend**: A Node.js server using Express.js to handle AI-based plant identification.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher) installed on your machine.
- A working API key for AI-based plant identification.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com//plant-guard.git
   cd plant-guard
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root for the frontend and add:
     ```
     REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000/api/identify
     ```
   - For the backend, create a `.env` file in the backend folder and add:
     ```
     GEMINI_API_KEY=your-google-generative-ai-key
     PORT=5000
     ```

4. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd Backend
   node server.js
   ```

5. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. Open your browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Scripts

### `npm start`

- Runs the app in development mode.
- Access it at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### `npm run build`

- Builds the app for production.
- Outputs to the `build` folder.

### `npm test`

- Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run lint`

- Runs ESLint to analyze code for potential errors.

## Backend API

### Endpoint: `POST /api/identify`

- **Request Body**:
  - `image`: Base64-encoded string of the image.
  - `mimeType`: MIME type of the image (e.g., `image/png`).
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "Plant Name",
    "scientificName": "Scientific Name",
    "family": "Plant Family",
    "care": ["Care instruction 1", "Care instruction 2"]
  }
  ```

## Deployment

1. Build the production-ready files:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Deploy the `build` folder to your hosting service (e.g., Hostinger, Netlify).

3. Ensure the backend is also deployed and configured with the correct API key.
